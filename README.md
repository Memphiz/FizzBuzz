# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a simple programming problem I like to solve with job candidates using pair-programming. 

To get started hand the [problem description](fizzbuzz.txt) to the candidate. If needed, briefly explain [the TDD-cycle](https://i2.wp.com/www.funkysi1701.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tdd_flow.gif?resize=287%2C300&ssl=1). Depending on the candidate's experience/knowledge let him/her start writing the first unit test or write the first one as an ice-breaker yourself.

After 30-45 minutes you might be done, sitting in front of a [classic_solution](classic_solution). Ask the candiate if he/she knows about the [open-closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openâ€“closed_principle) or briefly explain it, if not. Let the candidate think about [a solution of the problem that conforms this principle](open_closed_solution). Discuss about its pros and cons (complexity, amount of classes, size of classes, extensibility, ...). You can use [this image](open_closed_solution/fizzbuzz_open_closed.PNG) as discussion/explanation basis. Feel free to extend this image using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io). The drawio-file [is provided here](open_closed_solution), as well.
